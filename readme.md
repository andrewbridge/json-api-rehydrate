# JSON:API rehydrate

A quick little js method for converting data from a json:api endpoint back in to a hierarchical data structure.

Please note, this is just a little project for playing around so the code is still pretty dirty & it hasn't been tested against a very wide selection of valid response data.

```
	let data = jsonApiRehydrate(myJsonAPiResponce);
```
